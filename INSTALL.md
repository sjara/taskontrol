# TASKontrol installation and setup

The steps necessary to get started on any operating system are summarized as follows:

1. Download the source code for TASKontrol using git:
  `git clone git://github.com/sjara/taskontrol.git`
2. Install python, PySide (which depends on Qt4), numpy and h5py.
  * For data plots, you will also need matplotlib and [pyqtgraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/).
  * For sound stimuli, you will need [pyo](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/) and [pyserial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/).
3. Create the file `taskontrol/settings/rigsettings.py` based on `rigsettings_template.py` and change values according to your setup.
4. Add the folder containing `taskontrol` to the Python path.
5. Test your system with one of the example paradigms.


## Installation steps for Ubuntu 14.04 (or 12.04).

Note that these step will result in a local installation (not system-wide).

* Before starting, you may need to update the list of packages:
  * `sudo apt-get update`

* Install dependencies:
  * `sudo apt-get install git ipython python-pyside python-numpy python-matplotlib python-h5py python-pyo python-serial`

* Some widgets/plots depend on pyqtgraph (faster than matplotlib). Download the .deb file from http://luke.campagnola.me/debian/dev/ and install with the following command (using the appropriate version number):
  * `sudo dpkg -i python-pyqtgraph_0.9.8-1_all.deb`

* For (experimental) "real-time" sound presentation, you would also need:
  * `sudo apt-get install linux-lowlatency jackd`

* Create and go to the directory where you want the code:
  * `mkdir ~/src`
  * `cd ~/src/`

* Clone source code from repository:
  * `git clone git://github.com/sjara/taskontrol.git`

* Define the settings for this rig:
  * `cd ~/src/taskontrol/settings/`
  * `cp rigsettings_template.py rigsettings.py`
  * [edit rigsettings.py to match your settings, e.g. STATE_MACHINE_TYPE]

* Add directory to python path:
  * `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/src`
  * (this only works for the current terminal. Add this to `~/.bashrc` if you want the path change to be permanent)

* If using an arduino as server, you need to have access to the serial port:
  * Add yourself to the dialout group: `sudo usermod -aG dialout <username>`
  * You need to re-login for this to take effect.

### Testing the system:
* Set the appropriate value for STATE_MACHINE_TYPE in `~/src/taskontrol/settings/rigsettings.py`. To test with the emulator, this should be set to `'emulator'`.
* In a terminal, go to the examples directory:
  * `cd ~/src/taskontrol/examples/`
  * From a terminal, run a simple example:
    * `python example003_dispatcher.py`
    * you should see a small window with a 'run' button.

* Full documentation can be found at http://taskontrol.readthedocs.org


## Installation steps for Windows

These instructions assume you have installed the following applications:
1. Python (via the Anaconda Individual Edition): https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows
1. git (64bit): https://git-scm.com/download/win
  * Recommended: during installation, choose Nano as the default editor.

Open the Anaconda Powershell Prompt to follow the steps below:
1. Create a virtual environment:
  * conda create -n taskontrol --clone base
1. Activate the virtual environment:
  * conda activate taskontrol
  * If successful, `(taskontrol)` should appear at the beginning of your prompt.
1. Install dependencies:
  * FINISH THIS SECTION
  * conda install XXXXX
  * conda install -c conda-forge YYYYY
1. Choose or create a folder to install this package and go to that folder:
  * `mkdir ~/src/`
  * `cd ~/src/`
1. Clone the repository:
  * `git clone --single-branch --branch python3 https://github.com/sjara/taskontrol.git`
1. Install the package in editable/development mode:
  * `cd taskontrol`
  * `pip install -e .`
1. Create a local rigsettings file:
  * FINISH THIS SECTION



## TROUBLESHOOTING:

For each error (E) we describe a probable cause (C) and solution (S):

* E: System only shows "Waiting for Arduino to be ready..." and never connects:
  * C: You have no access to the serial port, or the arduino is not available (unplugged).
  * S: See above for how to add yourself to the 'dialout' group.

* E: 'ImportError: No module named PySide
  * C: The necessary modules (in this case PySide) have not been installed correctly.
  * S: Install all the dependencies as explained above.

* E: 'ImportError: No module named taskontrol.settings'
  * C:  Your PYTHON path is not setup correctly.
  * S:  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/src
