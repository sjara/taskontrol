* Docs:
*** DONE Clean up taskontrol.core
*** TODO Document taskontrol.core
*** TODO Clean up taskontrol.plugins

* Solving the START/STOP dispatcher issue to advance one trial
*** DONE Find how dispatcher knows that a new trial has happened
    It polls past events and checks if machine has reached state 0
    method timeout() checks if self.currentState in self.prepareNextTrialStates
    it then emits prepareNextTrial
*** 

* To do soon:

*** DONE BUG!!! if a timer is up and Tup transition does not exist (i.e. it stays in state)
    the system starts generating Tup events after time 0 without stopping
    (At least in the emulator, not sure about the real thing)
    Is it because it does not enter the state again? Check line 207 statemachine.ino
    OPTIONS:
***** Re-enter state (execute enter_state) when timer is up
      (the user needs to be aware of this to avoid overflowing the events matrix)
      it has the consequence that it re-starts extratimers (???)
      The problem is that any other event that does not produce a transition
      will also re-start timers!
***** Do not execute enter_state when timer is up but no transition
      but reset timer.
      Does this solve the problem of the timer event being trigger ad-infinitum?
***** SOLUTION: the emulator was missing a 'self.' in front of stateTimerValue
      Everything should work fine (emulator and sm) without running enter_state

*** DONE remove the old soundclient.py
*** TODO When stopping dispatcher, the system should label that trial as invalid
    and prepare a new one when pressing start again. Be careful that it does not
    add a new trial at the end of a session when stop is pressed.
    Think if it's good to prepare a trial when pressing START. (first time and after)
*** TODO Object to set layout
*** TODO sidesplot.py: allow giving dict of outcomes/colors as parameter.
*** TODO sidesplot.py: make dialog with color-code
*** TODO sidesplot.py: allow more than just filled circles.
*** TODO FEATURE: have a method to add elements to params. For example:
    self.params.add(type='Numeric',name='leftProb',label='Prob left',value=0.5,group='Choice')
*** TODO Find which serial port has the state machine.
*** TODO Make emulator show all other outputs
*** DONE dispatcher: make _set_state_matrix() which takes lists
    and change set_state_matrix() to take sm as input (and define get_ready_states)
*** DONE enable saving strings
*** TODO savedata.py Send to remote repository
***** TODO Make remote dir recursively.
***** TODO Make a backup of the file if already exists
*** TODO savedata.py Update database
*** TODO dispatcher.set_state_matrix() needs parameters by name
*** TODO SoundClient needs a way to die gracefully.
*** TODO smclient should have a way to define the serial port, and
    dispatcher should read the one from rigsettings
*** TODO What happens if rigsettings defines outputs #1 and #3, but not #2?
*** TODO Inputs in arduino may need to be pull-down by hardware
*** TODO Check versions of SM server and client are the same When connecting.
*** DONE plugins/loadparameters (Find an easy way to set parameters )
*** DONE When failing, it should disconnect the state machine
    Just create dispatcher the latest you can
*** TODO Check that outputs work by using the LED on the arduino.
*** TODO save a checksum of the Paradigm code to verify that version is the same
*** DONE ManualControl (see plugins)
*** TODO StyleSheets (see stylesheets and manualcontrol)
*** DONE Finish fixing savedata given subject/experimenter/date/suffix.
*** TODO Save paradigm name somewhere in the data (see sessionData in the HDF5 file)
*** DONE Example008: estimate times
*** TODO Disassemble events and extract choice, times, etc.
*** TODO Make a protocol that uses extra timers with statematrix.py
*** TODO Check doc string on each method of core (start with dispatcher)
*** DONE Save results and parameters on the same location 'root/trialData'
*** TODO SaveData:
***** TODO Add paradigm name to file name
***** TODO Be smart if data file exists
*** TODO StateMatrix:
***** TODO Check validity of state matrix sm.get_matrix(verify=True)
      Useful after reset and redefined.
***** TODO statematrix.py : Check if there are orphan states.
***** DONE The objects should be created only once per paradigm
***** DONE On each trial, it once should 'reset-trasitions', and redefine them
      This way the list of states is unique (valid for all trials)
***** DONE Is a state exists, use it and update its transitions
*** DONE Add extra timers to statematrix.py
*** DONE Connect run/stop signals to messenger (example007)
*** DONE Load data saved by SaveData. See examples/test002_readdata.py
*** DONE SaveData:
***** DONE Avoid error when saving before RUN
***** DONE Fix interactive saving
***** DONE Close file if there is an error while saving to it
***** DONE Save rawEvents as one array of times and one of integer transitions
*** DONE savedata.SaveData.to_file() should not have a parameter of type paramgui.Container
    because it is defined in another module and I should avoid dependencies.
    SOLUTION: this method takes as input a list of objects with method append_to_file()
              it doesn't matter what object type as long as it has that method.

* MINIPROJECT:
*** DONE Separate rawEvents into times and transitions.
*** Data comes to dispatcher as [prevstate time nextstate]
*** Should save as [time] and [prevstate, nextstate]
*** protocol.save_to_file() calls
    self.saveData.to_file(self.params,self.dispatcherModel.eventsMat)

* To do later:
*** TODO Add test cases for each module/method
*** TODO Design water reward module.
*** TODO Write protocol for calibration water.
*** TODO Make specific exceptions when needed.
*** TODO Make an emulator (in addition to the dummy)
*** TODO SaveData.to_file takes very specific inputs (like a paramgui.Container)

* To do (extra plugins):
*** TODO Fix eventsplot [2/3]
***** DONE Color disappearing earlier that it should
***** TODO Plot events, not just states
***** DONE setStatesColor, use state names
*** TODO Module for creating generic sounds (tones, noise, AM, FM, etc)
*** TODO Graphical interface (detachable) for setting sound parameters.


* Bugs and fixes:
*** TODO Some of the core classes/methods depend on settings.rigsettings.
    This simplifies the way these methods are called, but it may change in the
    future to eliminate cross-dependencies.
*** TODO paramgui.Container.update_history() may create trouble. The history
    for each parameter is stored as a list (and append() is used to update it).
    This may get out of sync with trial-number if user calls update_history()
    more than once within a trial.
*** TODO The way data is saved makes it difficult to replace the format.
    Currently, savedata calls the append_to_file method of each module. That means
    all modules have to agree on the type of file. There should be a file-type
    independent interface.
*** TODO Unplugged inputs are floating (not pull-up or pull-down).
    How to make sure these don't cause problems?
    The software should only look at defined/connected inputs.
*** TODO Is FORCE_OUTPUT compatible with the way we deal with outputs,
    and the fact that a state may not change some outputs?
*** TODO What happens if Dispatcher.timeout() gets called too often?
    Should I stop the calls to timeout while processing things inside it?
*** TODO Test if get_events() disturbs the timing of the state machine.
*** TODO When importing core modules from core modules, should I do it absolute or
    relative (from taskontrol.core import xxx, or just import xxx)
*** TODO Check the way paramgui.MenuItems are saved. Maybe use append_dict_to_HDF5
    instead of attributes.
*** TODO On sidesplot, the graph jumps (changes slightly the x axes) after the first
    trial. It must be something weird about pyqtgraph.
*** TODO When saving a file that existed before, h5py seems to load information from the 
    old file not the truncated version. SOLUTION: maybe the file was still open in ipython
*** TODO The rawEvents could be saved as one matrix [eventTime eventCode nextState]
    or as three vectors (float, int, int). The latter option will make file smaller (and
    maybe faster), but more cumbersome to save/load.
*** TODO For default 2-AFC paradigm:
        # FIXME: There is an alternative way with states 'RewardLeft' 'RewardRight'
        ###### FIXME: you should define the states only once, but define transitions
        ############# for each trial. That way you ensure the same statesDict every time.
*** TODO it looks like sched waves cannot be triggered on State 0.
*** TODO if the time from State 0 to another state is zero, it never moves.
*** TODO currentTrial is sent by signal to startNewTrial(), but can also be
    accessed from protocol.dispatcher.currentTrial
*** TODO what happens if signal 'READY TO START TRIAL' is sent while on JumpState?
    does it jump to new trial or waits for timeout?
*** TODO If using IPython there is a segfault if you run a protocol,
    close its window and try to run it again.
    It seems to be related to Qt4 not the StateMachine.
    See .../test/test012_qt4segfault.py  and this link
    http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-user/2007-November/004797.html
*** TODO A python bug? about conditionally importing modules.
    The following code for alternative loading of dummy smclient:
    if dummy:
	    #from taskontrol.plugins import smdummy as smclient
	    reload(smclient)
    gives the error:
      local variable 'smclient' referenced before assignment
*** TODO Antipatterns:
***** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_coupling (on smclient)
***** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BaseBean (on netclient)
*** TODO Why are sched waves an attribute of the class?
    but the state matrix is not?
*** TODO QtGui.QFileDialog.getSaveFileName() is horribly slow.
    But only when run from from ipython. Maybe it is related to the
    following bug, since the error message does not appear under ipython:
    https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=210904
    (5001) findLibraryInternal: plugins should not have a 'lib' prefix: "libkfilemodule.so"
    (5001) KPluginLoader::load: The plugin "libkfilemodule" doesn't contain a kde_plugin_verification_data structure
*** DONE I have been using =smIDstr.split()[0]= to extract values,
    but maybe this will change if I split things in DoQueryCmd()
*** DONE I seem to be sending extra strings after GetEvents()
    The server says: "Got:  " and then "Connection to host ended..."
    SOLUTION: I just had to restart the FSM server to avoid this.
*** DONE Check if realines can be done by reading up to a line-break
    Probably not, because if server sends a byte representing the same
    as a '\n', there is no way to tell which one of the two it was.
*** DONE Socket timeout is a weird way of stop receiving from socket.
    Although I don't know if there is a better way.  Note: I had to
    increase the timeout to avoid raising exceptions all time. So
    while in the C code it was 1ms, in the python client it is
    100ms. See NetClient.cpp: NetClient::receiveLines()
*** DONE GetTimeEventsAndState repeats code from DoQueryMatrixCmd
    It should be more modular.
*** DONE Many methods request one parameter (bool, int or float) and OK.
    There should be a method for this.
*** DONE Make orouting a dict instead of a class
*** DONE Fix getTimeEventsAndState (to use methods from BaseClient)
*** DONE Show current trial in dispatcher
*** DONE If prepareNextTrialStates has more than two states,
    they may both emit signals. That is not correct.


* Questions:
*** What is the state matrix column called CONT_OUT in SetStateMatrix?
*** What is the state matrix column called TRIG_OUT in SetStateMatrix?
*** What does BypassDout() do?
    The comment says that it sets outputs to be whatever the state
    machine would indicate, bitwise or `d with "d."
*** How are sched waves sent to the server?
    The comments seem to indicate that they get concatenated to the
    state matrix, but is this column or row-wise? Couldn't we just
    send the state matrix first and then the sched waves?
*** Does the input_event_mapping need to know about ScheduleWaves?
    Since it is sent to the server as the last row of the matrix, it seems so,
    but then, what is the appropriate value for a SW input?
*** Do event numbers start from 1 or 0 (when using GET_EVENTS %d %d)?
*** What is the number of columns of the events-matrix? 4 or 5?
    The fifth one used to be the Nspike time. Is it still in use?
*** Why do we need 'READY TO START TRIAL' (and ready_for_trial_jumpstate)?
    shouldn't that be implemented by the client with 'FORCE STATE %d'
    The only reason I see if you want the SM to do something while
    preparing the next trial, and don't want to jump out of it in the
    middle of something (but only when it reaches a special state).
    

* Python tips and code improvements:
*** Write docstrings according to PEP257:
    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
*** DONE Use isinstance(obj, int) instead of comparing types
*** TODO Do not compare with == (singleton), use 'is'
*** TODO Don't compare boolean values to True or False using ==
*** DONE Use .join() instead of +=
*** TODO Be explicit about which exception is catched
*** DONE endswith() instead of slicing string
*** TODO Use code-testing: :CODE_TESTING:

	But running "ipython -pdb" worked.
******* Trying to use pydb failed because it installed only for python2.4
******* SOLUTION: running 'ipython -pdb' worked fine.
***** DONE TAB-autocompletion:
      It adds a blank space after the completion, very annoying.

******* SOLUTION: link  libreadline.so.6 to libreadline.so.5.2
	instead of linking to libreadline.so.6.0
***** Profiler has to be installed separately because of its license:
      The Debian package is called 'python-profiler'.
      In any case, it didn't really work the way I wanted. Gotta try again.
***** TODO Automatic reloading of modules
      Running one script does not reload the modules it imports, so
      any changes to those modules are ignored until reloading explicitely.

* Misc:
*** FIXED (2010-05-12) see ./compiling_FSMemulator.txt
    I can't run the emulator on Ubuntu 9.10 because of a bug (in glibc?) about threads.
    It run fine on Ubuntu 9.04. I think the bug is related to:
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glib2.0/+bug/453898
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=599079


* Design:
*** StateMachineClient
    connect, setStateMatrix, setScheduleWaves, run, halt, getEvents, and more.
*** SoundClient
    connect, loadSound, and more.
*** Dispatcher
    Qt widget with a run button and a display of the time and state of the SM.
    It keeps time and trial count, and serves as the interface for setting the state
    transition matrix and getting events back.
*** Protocol
    Design state matrix and parameters.
*** paramgui.Container
    Dictionary holding all graphical parameter. It has methods to help layout.
*** paramgui.StringParam, paramgui.NumericParam, paramgui.MenuParam
    Object holding a label and value. It will be saved for each trial.
    It can be: label+editbox or menu
*** NOT IMPLEMENTED:
***** SoundManager
      It does not seem necessary. SoundClient.loadSound() would do.


* Adding schedule waves:
*** output_routing has to know about the SW because setStateMatrix
    sends a URLstring with that info.
*** It looks like self.input_event_mapping does not need to change for SW
    so there is no need for calling setInputEvents.


* Debugging (and what happens on each type of error):
*** Best option so far is use only QtCore.pyqtRemoveInputHook() and 'ipython -pdb'
*** Using 'ipython -pdb'
***** SyntaxError: it shows location of error (does not enter debug mode).
***** AttributeError, NameError, TypeError on __init__:
      it stops before GUI and enters (ipdb) debug mode.
***** NameError on prepareNextTrial():
      ipdb> QCoreApplication::exec: The event loop is already running
      (... indefinitely, until hitting CTRL-C)
      If running outside ipython, it shows the error and continues.
*** Two solutions:
***** QtCore.pyqtRemoveInputHook()
      On 'ipython -pdb' shows trace invokes pdb.
      On 'python file.py' shows trace and continues.
      On 'ipython -pdb -q4thread' shows trace and continues.
      I don't know how to stop dispatcher using only that.
***** Redefine sys.excepthook
      On 'ipython -pdb' it can show trace and stop dispatcher.
      On 'python file.py'  ???
      On 'ipython -pdb -q4thread' ???
      I don't know how to invoke pdb inside ipython when redefining sys.excepthook.
***** Best option so far is use only QtCore.pyqtRemoveInputHook() and 'ipython -pdb'
      But then if you run the protocol with 'python file.py', you may not realize
      that there has been an error.
