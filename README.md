#  TASKontrol

TASKontrol is an open source framework for developing behavioral experiments for neuroscience research.

It consists of modules written in Python and Qt (via QtPy) for designing behavioral paradigms and providing a graphical user interface to control the experiments. It also includes software that runs in an [Arduino Due](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDue) to provide an interface for detecting external events and triggering stimuli.

TASKontrol was developed by Santiago Jaramillo and it is maintained by the [Jaramillo Lab](http://jaralab.uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon. The framework was largely inspired by systems such as [BControl](http://brodywiki.princeton.edu/bcontrol) and the [Linux+RTAI statemachine](https://github.com/cculianu/rt-fsm) originally developed at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
